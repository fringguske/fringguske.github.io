--The dataset contained information on housing data in the Nashville, TN area. I used SQL Server to clean the data to make it easier to use. For example, I converted some dates to remove unnecessary timestamps; I populated data for null values; I changed address columns from containing all of the address, city and state into separate columns; I changed a column that had different representations of the same data into consistent usage; I removed duplicate rows; and I deleted unused columns
